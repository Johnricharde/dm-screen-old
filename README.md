# Digital DM-Screen


This project is a web-app with the purpose of helping the game master of a D&D campaign keep track of information.
It is similiar in use to the physical version called a "DM Screen" or "GM Screen".

Why is this needed?
If you've ever been the DM of a group playing D&D then you know that it can be quite chaotic to try and keep track of everything all at once.
This is what this project is going to try to remedy.

For those who are already familiar with D&D, here are some of the things that this app might be able to help with:
- Easy Search access to information contained within the D&D 5E rulebook, spellbook or bestiary.
- Keep track of the initiativ order in combat while also displaying the current initiativ holders abilities
  (Example: If it's a goblins turn then it will display your available actions as "Nimble Escape", "Schimitar" and "Shortbow")
- Keep your own personal notes within the web-app.

  Other functionality might be added as the project grows.
